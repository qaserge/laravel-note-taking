Note-Taking Application:

A convenient application that allows users to organize their notes. Here are some key features and architectural decisions used in the development of this program:

Registration and Login: Users have the option to register in the application by creating an account or log in if they are already registered.

Security and Safety: Breeze package is used for authentication to ensure a reliable and secure authentication mechanism.

Notes: Users can create notes, edit them, as well as delete them to the trash or permanently remove them from the system. This provides a simple and convenient way to manage personal notes.

Architectural Reliability: Laravel Best Practices and SOLID principles were followed during development, ensuring the application's stability and ease of further development.

Models and Migrations: The program uses models and migrations to manage the database, ensuring structured and consistent data.

Resource Controller for CRUD: A Resource Controller is used to manage notes, simplifying the execution of CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

Blade Components and Directives: Blade components and directives are used to create the user interface, making development easier and improving code readability.

Route Model Binding: The application benefits from Route Model Binding, making it easier to access notes using their identifiers, resulting in clearer and more understandable code.

Eloquent Relationships: The use of Eloquent relationships allows the creation of connections between models, simplifying data handling and database queries.

Soft Deletion of Models: To ensure data integrity, deleted notes are first moved to the trash (soft deletion) before being permanently removed from the database.

Adherence to Conventions and Best Practices: During the development of the application, Laravel Best Practices and SOLID principles were followed to maintain clean and readable code.
